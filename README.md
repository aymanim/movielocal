This is a simple script to:

- connets to an FTP movie store which just has a bunch of movies
- iteratively gets a list of all movies (.avi, .wmv, etc...)
- Cleans up the file name a little (removes weird symbols)
- Searches the internet for the file name and finds matching real movies
- Picks the most probable movie and gets a link to its listing


Future:

Benefit of having a clean name is that it will be easy to get more information about that movie from multiple sources (rotten tomatoes, imdb, etc.)

This will allow the script to display a simple HTML page with path to local movie and its ratings from various sources
